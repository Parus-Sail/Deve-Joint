            "body": "When you talk about Google's Pixel Fold, it's tough not to focus mostly on the phone's form.\r\n\r\nI mean, this is a device whose screen folds in half, for cryin' out loud! It may not be the first Android phone to feature that feat, but still: It's without a doubt the device's defining characteristic. And it's quite a sight to see, even in passing, and even more so to experience in your own pockets and person-paws.\r\n\r\nWhile it's easy to obsess over the Fold's fold, though, we've been there and done that at this point. And now that I've personally been totin' the Pixel Fold around in my pantaloons for a solid month (somehow!), I want to move beyond the surface and focus a little more closely on what might actually be the Fold's most significant innovation from an Android-wide, platform perspective.\r\n\r\nNominations are open for the 2024 Best Places to Work in IT\r\nHere's the thing: The folding screen sure is something — to say the very least! — but it isn't exactly gonna be a standard productivity tool anytime soon. It'll be a good long while before most average Homo sapiens have folding phones, if such a time ever arrives, and so the immediate impact of the form is pretty darn limited.\r\n\r\nBut the true brilliance of Google's Pixel Fold philosophy is something that's actually unrelated to the form itself. And it's something that could — and arguably should — affect anyone using any Android device, regardless of its form or foldability.",

            "body": "The number of weekly job postings related to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and Cohere’s Coral, leapt more than 450% from a year ago, according to a new report from work marketplace Upwork.\r\n\r\nAnd the types of job skills related to AI are also skyrocketing. Upwork’s freelance job site lists 294 skills under “AI Services.” Roles gaining steam include prompt engineers, AI content creators, machine learning and deep learning engineers, data scientists, AI chatbot developers, and professionals with model tuning and AI model integration expertise, according to Dave Bottoms, general manager of Upwork Marketplace.\r\n\r\nAI is now the fastest-growing category on Upwork in the first half of 2023 as measured by total number of individuals hired.\r\n\r\n[ Prepare for generative AI with experimentation and clear guidelines ]\r\nKory Kantenga, a senior economist at LinkedIn, said the share of job postings mentioning \"GPT\" or \"ChatGPT\" increased nearly sixfold (599%) between May 2022 and May 2023 — and the number of LinkedIn members who hold or have held \"head of AI\" positions has almost tripled in the last five years.\r\n\r\nGenerative AI is a type of AI that uses data analytics, natural language processing, neural networks, and machine learning to autonomously create text, images, video, and even computer code.\r\n\r\n“We’re seeing that businesses are looking for independent professionals on Upwork with expertise in AI tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Jasper, and more,” Bottoms said. “These job posts are up 230% in Q2 2023 compared to Q4 2022.”\r\n\r\nUpwork created its own AI-based job post generator to help clients quickly create fully customizable job post drafts. Upwork also launched a chatbot to help businesses new to Upwork navigate the platform and learn how to jumpstart their talent search.\r\n\r\n[ REGISTER NOW for the flagship event of the year! CIO 100 Symposium & Awards, August 14-16 ]\r\n“Separately, we are also beta testing a new feature called proposal tips that helps talent create more professional proposals in an instant, without requiring months of training — helping them win more work,” Bottoms said.\r\n\r\nAnd the company has launched a free trial of Jasper’s AI tools through Upwork’s partnership with them. The generative AI services can be used for copywriting, marketing, and image creation; it's available to job seekers using Upwork’s jobs platform.\r\n\r\nOther job site platforms are following the same trend. \r\n\r\nJosh Brenner, CEO of job-search platform Hired, said the demand for AI-related engineers has increased since the beginning of 2023, though there was a dip from January to February — possibly due to industry layoffs occuring around that time.\r\n\r\n\"Since February, there has been a significant rebound in the demand for AI-related software engineers, with active positions for these roles nearly doubling,\" Brenner said in an email response to Computerworld. \"The most substantial surge occurred between March and April, indicating a positive trend in the job market for AI-related professionals.\"\r\n\r\nThe top skills employers want include Python, machine learning, AWS, SQL, and Java, according to Brenner. \"Among these, Python stands out as the most sought-after skill, with employers requesting it almost twice as much as machine learning,\" he said.",

            "body": "Google has announced it is making its Bard chatbot available in the EU and Brazil, five months after the company opened it up for early access. To date, residents in EU countries have been unable to access the company’s ChatGPT rival due to issues surrounding data privacy concerns.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making Bard more widely available, Google has also introduced a host of new features including text-to-speech capabilities, shareable Bard conversation links, Google Lens compatibility, and the ability to customize Bard responses — for example, adjusting for tone and style.\r\n\r\nBard is also now available in over 40 new languages including Arabic, simplified and traditional Chinese, German, Hindi, Spanish, according to a blog post by Jack Krawczyk, product lead for Bard..\r\n\r\n[ Bing’s AI chatbot came to work for me. I had to fire it. ]\r\n“As part of our bold and responsible approach to AI, we’ve proactively engaged with experts, policymakers and privacy regulators on this expansion,” Krawczyk wrote. “As we bring Bard to more regions and languages over time, we’ll continue to use our AI Principles as a guide, incorporate user feedback, and take steps to protect people’s privacy and data.”\r\n\r\nThe link to the privacy and data protection guidelines details information including the length of time Bard stores user information, how users can change that timeframe, and the type of information it stores.\r\n\r\nGoogle had originally intended to launch Bard in the EU in June but was forced to postpone its plan after the Irish Data Protection Commission, the EU’s main data regulator, said the company had failed to provide sufficient information about how the chatbot would protect the privacy of those living in the EU.\r\n\r\nLike other generative AI chatbots, Bard is powered by a large language model (LLM), in this case a lightweight variant of LaMDA, Google’s main natural-language processing model.\r\n\r\n[ REGISTER NOW for the flagship event of the year! CIO 100 Symposium & Awards, August 14-16 ]\r\n“This much smaller model requires significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users, allowing for more feedback,” Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post when Bard was first introduced. “We’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.”\r\n\r\nHowever, soon after its launch, Bloomberg reported that Google employees had branded the chatbot “worse than useless” and a “pathological liar” and begged the company to delay its release after Bard continued to provide a high number of factually incorrect or made-up responses. Users of other generative AI chatbots including ChatGPT have reported factually innacurate and completely made-up responses to queries — a phenomenon known as \"hallucinating.\"",

            "preamble": "Business demand for desktops and laptops is expected to return to growth early next year after a series of declines in recent quarters.",
            "body": "Global PC shipments fell during the second quarter of 2023, according to preliminary data from two analyst firms, but recent sales offered some indication of a market turnaround following recent historic declines.\r\n\r\nShipments of desktop and laptop devices fell 16.6% year-on-year during the April-June quarter, according to the latest figures from Gartner, while IDC pegged the decrease at a higher-than-anticipated 13.4%.\r\n\r\nThe figures contrast with even sharper declines in recent quarters, with both analyst firms reporting dramatic sales drops  of roughly 30% year-on-year in April.\r\n\r\n[ Buyer’s guide: How to choose the right business laptops ]\r\nThe slowing decline is an indication that shipment volumes may have already reached a nadir, according to Gartner director analyst Mikako Kitagawa, with a rebound in business spending on devices expected in 2024.\r\n\r\n“There has been progress in reducing PC inventory after more than a year of issues, supported by a gradual increase in business PC demand,” Kitagawa said. “Gartner expects that PC inventory will normalize by the end of 2023, and PC demand will return to growth starting in 2024.”\r\n\r\nMarket leader Lenovo saw double-digit declines globally during the second quarter, with EMEA and Asia Pacific challenging regions for the vendor, said Gartner. The company fared slightly better in Latin America and North America, however.\r\n\r\nDell and Acer both also saw double-digit declines, with Dell experiencing its fifth consecutive quarterly decrease. HP’s shipments remained roughly flat during the second quarter, according to both analyst firms.\r\n\r\n[ REGISTER NOW for the flagship event of the year! CIO 100 Symposium & Awards, August 14-16 ]\r\nOne bright spot did show up for the overall market: Apple’s shipments grew 10.3% year on year, according to IDC, as supply chain issues in the second quarter of 2022 eased. Another analyst firm, Canalys, reported a 51% increase for Apple during the same period, noting demand for the popular new 15-in. Macbook Air.\r\n\r\nOverall shipments in the US declined 8.6%, falling to 18.1 million, Gartner noted, as a relatively stable economy allayed business  concerns, generating demand for PCs. There was notable investment in Chromebooks by educational institutions, along with public sector spending on laptops, the analyst firm said.\r\n\r\nThe EMEA market fared worse. It was down 14.6%, the sixth consecutive quarterly decline; political unrest, inflationary pressure and interest rate hikes dampened demand.\r\n\r\n“The disruptive business outlook is limiting business PC spending in EMEA, as companies reduce PC budgets as a cost management strategy,” said Kitagawa. “Business confidence must increase to influence stronger PC buying patterns. Meanwhile, consumer demand remains low, as all income brackets are affected by inflationary pressures.”\r\n\r\nEconomic uncertainty in China also affected PC demand, contributing significantly to a 26.9% decline in Asia Pacific.\r\n\r\nTotal global shipments during the second quarter amounted to 59.6 million according to Gartner; IDC pegged global shipments at 61.6 million.\r\n\r\nAmid some signs of optimism for growth later this year, the outlook for business spending remains uncertain.\r\n\r\n“On the commercial side, workforce reductions (for many big companies) as well as the introduction of generative AI only add more confusion as to where to place an already reduced budget,” said Ryan Reith, group vice president for IDC's Client Device Trackers.",
