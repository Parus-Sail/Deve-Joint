Their role is to create mobile or desktop software based on the stakeholders’ standards. Programmers also debug and test applications to ensure they are error-free and perform smoothly. Once the product is finished, they will also need to maintain it. Software often needs to be updated, and programmers must identify potential bugs in the system. Then, they will troubleshoot it to make sure it has seamless performance. A developer can specialize in either front end or backend programming. They can also become full-stack software engineers and work in both areas, but it requires a lot of work. Front end development represents the client-side of the programming process. This includes the design and visual elements of the website or application. Backend, on the other hand, is the process behind the curtains. It includes database creation and maintenance, servers, APIs, etc.",

      "summary": "Front end developers build the parts of websites and apps you interact with everyday. They understand what a user needs and they anticipate how you will try to retrieve that information. They then use this knowledge to program a seamless user experience from start to finish. Meanwhile, back end developers build the server-side infrastructure of a website or app that pulls that data for the user. Full stack developers are jack of all trades. They work on (you guessed it!) the full stack, and can develop for both the front end and the back end. It might be easier to think of it this way -- imagine you’re building a house for a user to live in. Back end developers are the ones responsible for everything happening behind the walls. They install utilities like electrical wires, water pipes, and heating/cooling systems.",
